The URL Shortener Service provides the following functionality:

Users can enter a URL on a page and get back a shortened version. The shortened version of a URL is the same for every shortening request.

For each shortened URL, the following statistics are kept:
How often was the URL shortened?
How often was the shortened URL accessed?
Anyone can see the statistics. It should also be displayed automatically after each shortening.
